# ShrinkIt Archive Library for Java

This project is a direct off-shoot of the AppleCommander project and implements a pure Java API to manipulate ShrinkIt (NuFX) 
archives ([Apple File Type Note $E0/8002](http://www.apple2online.com/web_documents/ft_e0.8002_shrinkit.pdf)).

*Developers*

Being new to Gradle, all of the Maven release components are in the `build.gradle` file.  More a warning than anything, just in case it causes issues.  Please make more portable and submit a PR.
